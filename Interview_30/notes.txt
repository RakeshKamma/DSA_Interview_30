step by step procedure- 

1.Ask interviewer required questions about the problem like empty case and some examples etc
2.write out those test cases and recheck the correct output
3.figure out a solution without writing the code
4.brute force first and test with test cases and explain time and space complexity
5.optimized apprach and test with test cases and explain time and space complexity


Notes -
1. After brute force approach, compare the time and space complexity for example time-O(N^2) and space is O(1). From these two we 
analyze that the difference is lot so maybe we can use space here and reduce time.  
2. for iterating stuff do not iterate with values uses indicies
